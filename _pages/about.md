Hey! This is Jianping, or call me Mike! I'm currently a PhD student in AMSC (Applied Math & Statistics, and Scientific Computation) at University of Maryland, College Park, advised by Prof.[Michel Wedel](https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/directory/michel-wedel). I am concentrating on applying cutting-edge machine learning models to marketing. Before UMD, I was an undergrduate at UCLA, majoring in Applied Math with a concentration in scientific computing and a minor in bioinformatics. I was fortunate to work with Prof.[Samy Wu Fung](https://swufung.github.io/) on distributed optimization algorithms and Prof.[Chenfanfu Jiang](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~cffjiang/) and his group on physics-based simulations in computer graphics.
