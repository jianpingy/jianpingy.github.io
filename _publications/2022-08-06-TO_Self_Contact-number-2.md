Contact-aware topology optimization faces challenges in robustness, accuracy, and applicability to internal structural surfaces under self-contact. This work builds on the recently proposed barrier-based Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) model and presents a new self-contact-aware topology optimization framework. A combination of SIMP, adjoint sensitivity analysis, and the IPC frictional-contact model is investigated. Numerical examples for optimizing varying objective functions under contact are presented. The resulting algorithm proposed solves topology optimization for large deformation and complex frictionally contacting scenarios with accuracy and robustness.
